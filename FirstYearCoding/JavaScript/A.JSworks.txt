// About JS

JS is single threaded programming language and that can be non blocking
it is single threaded language beacuse it has only one call callstack
callstack is something that maintains the functions in a programm like it pushs the all functions and then pops them one by one

here 
cosole.log(1);
hugefunc();
alert(1);

it wil take time to execute the alert function as it have to complete the hugefunc first. its called blocking method

cosole.log(1);
setTimeout (hugefunc());
alert(1);

using setTimeout we can bypass the hugefunc for a while and executethe alert function first. this method is called non-blocking
